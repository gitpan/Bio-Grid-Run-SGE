=head1 JOB NOTIFICATIONS

To get job notifiations, create a global config file
F<$HOME/.bio-grid-run-sge.conf.yml>. It might be wise to restrict reading
permission, as you might use it to store account details (email, jabber,
twitter, etc.) for job notifiations.

  chmod 600 ~/.bio-grid-run-sge.conf
